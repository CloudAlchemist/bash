Title: Log Cleanup and Rotation Guide

Introduction:
This guide provides instructions on how to perform log cleanup and rotation using a Bash script and automate the process using cron jobs. Log cleanup and rotation are essential for managing log files efficiently, preventing disk space issues, and maintaining log data for analysis.

Script Usage:
1. Download the provided Bash script (log_cleanup.sh) to your server or local machine.

2. Open the script in a text editor and set the following variables:
   - LOG_DIR: The directory path where your log files are located.
   - LOG_EXTENSION: The file extension of the log files to be cleaned up.
   - RETENTION_PERIOD_WEEKS: The number of weeks to retain log files.

3. Save the changes to the script.

4. Make the script executable by running the following command in the terminal:

chmod +x log_cleanup.sh

5. Test the script manually by running it in the terminal:

./log_cleanup.sh

This command will perform log cleanup and rotation based on the configured parameters.

Automating with Cron:
1. Open the cron jobs configuration file for editing using the following command:

crontab -e

2. Add a new cron job entry to schedule the log cleanup script to run every Friday night. Use the following format:

0 0 * * 5 /path/to/log_cleanup.sh

This cron job entry runs the log cleanup script (/path/to/log_cleanup.sh) at midnight (0:00) every Friday (day of the week: 5).

3. Save the changes and exit the editor.

4. Verify that the cron job has been added successfully by listing the current cron jobs using the following command:

crontab -l

You should see the newly added cron job entry for the log cleanup script.

5. Sit back and relax! The cron job will automatically perform log cleanup and rotation every Friday night, ensuring that your log files are well-managed and maintained.

Note:
- Ensure that the script (log_cleanup.sh) has the necessary permissions to access and modify log files.
- Adjust the script parameters and cron job schedule according to your specific requirements and environment.
